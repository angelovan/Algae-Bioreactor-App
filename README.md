# Algae-Bioreactor-App
Algae Bioreactor App

A Django web application designed for students and teachers to create algae bioreactor units, track equipment, and manage feeding schedules. The application uses 3 different algae strains.

## Features
- **Bioreactor Management:** Users can register or update individual bioreactor units, cabinet (classroom) locations, setup dates, and observation notes.
- **Algae Strains:** Three specific algae cultures are available for selection when creating a bioreactor unit - *Chlorella vulgaris*, *Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina)*, and *Scenedesmus obliquus*.
- **Equipment:** Multiple pieces of lab equipment can be added and used for the created bioreactor units via Many-to-Many relationships.
- **Feeding Schedules:** Keep tabs on nutrient feed intervals, completion dates, and cycle notes. The next feeding due date is automatically calculated once the current feed is completed (time interval is 7 days).

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
- **Database:** SQLite (Time-zone aware dates using `DateField` and `timezone.localdate`)

## How to Use the App Efficiently

* **Add Algae Strains:** Start by adding your algae strain(s) and updating the optimal pH and temperature in the template (refer to the scientific notes below).
* **Add Equipment:** Log your equipment inventory. Examples include LED Growth Lights, Air Pumps, Submersible Mini Aquarium Heaters, Wide-Range pH Test Strips, Digital Aquarium Thermometers, Aquarium Airline Tubing & Check Valve, 10mL Plastic Syringes, and Pipettes.
* **Create a Bioreactor Unit:** Set up and register individual bioreactor units.
* **Manage Units:** Once created, bioreactor units can be easily edited or deleted. Use the "View" button to check their status and feeding schedule.
* **Track Feedings:** Document completed feedings with optional notes. Once a feed is marked as completed, the app automatically calculates and displays the next scheduled feed date.


## Algae Species Characteristics

* **Chlorella vulgaris** 
  * *Optimal Conditions:* Temperature 25°C – 30°C | pH 6.5 – 7.5.
  * *Resilience:* Highly resilient. Can survive temperature drops down to 10°C and pH swings from 5.0 to 9.0 without dying.
  * *Biology:* A unicellular, chlorophyte microalga characterized by its spherical morphology and efficient photosynthetic apparatus. Isolated in 1890, this organism served as a primary model for elucidating the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.

* **Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina)** 
  * *Optimal Conditions:* Temperature 35°C – 38°C | pH 9.0 – 11.0.
  * *Resilience:* High pH acts as a natural shield, preventing contamination from other algae or bacteria in a classroom setting.
  * *Biology:* A filamentous, multicellular, photosynthetic cyanobacterium colloquially designated as Spirulina.

* **Scenedesmus obliquus** 
  * *Optimal Conditions:* Temperature 20°C – 28°C | pH 7.0 – 8.0.
  * *Resilience:* Thrives at standard room temperature, making it excellent for cooler classrooms that turn off heating over the weekend.
  * *Biology:* A highly adaptive freshwater green alga found globally in common ponds, lakes, and puddles, making it a staple organism for ecological studies. Rather than living as single cells, it organizes into distinct, symmetrical colonies called coenobia, where four or eight football-shaped cells align side-by-side like a tiny log raft.
